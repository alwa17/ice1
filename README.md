This project is a project that is programmed to output meal suggestions to the user
according to the time of the day, depending if it is; morning, mid-moring, 
afternoon, mid-afternoon or dinner time. 
In this project I have use 2 screens, welcome screen, and main screen.
The welcome screen is the first screen and it displays a picture that well-suits
the applications purpose and a button navigating the user to the following page 
which is the main screen.
In the main screen there is a text display with instructions, a text input bar 
to enter needed information and a search button to display the relevant output to 
user according to time of the day, and there is also a reset button to restart the app
and navigates to the welcome page.
